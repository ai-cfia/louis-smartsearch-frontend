# Louis Finesse

## Introduction

Louis Finesse is a project designed to provide users with the ability to search for agency-related content and present search results. The application aims to streamline the process of finding information by offering a user-friendly interface and intuitive search functionality.

## Usage

### Home Page

The application currently consists of two main pages. The home page serves as the starting point for users. It features a clean and simple design, displaying the CFIA logo and an empty search bar. Users can easily enter their search queries into the search bar to initiate a search.

### Search Result Page

Upon submitting a search query, users are directed to the search result page. Here, they are presented with a list of search results retrieved from the back-end server. The search results are structured similarly to how Google displays its search results, featuring a title, URL, and a content body providing information about the web page.

If users click on any of the search result links, the corresponding webpage will open in a new tab, allowing for seamless exploration of relevant content.

### Navigation and Features

The application includes a header that prominently displays the CFIA banner. Clicking on the banner will redirect users to the official inspection.canada.ca website, providing easy access to additional resources and information.

To the right of the CFIA banner, users will notice an "Alpha Version" tag, indicating that the application is currently in its alpha stage of development. This serves as a reminder that the application is still being refined and may undergo further improvements.

The CFIA Finesse logo, located in the header, acts as a navigation button, allowing users to return to the home page at any time.

To perform a search, users can enter their query into the search bar. The search can be submitted either by clicking the arrow located on the right side of the search bar or by pressing the spacebar. Upon submission, users will be directed to the search result page, where they can explore the search results.

The search bar will retain the submitted query until the user decides to ask another question. Once the user starts typing in the search bar again, the previous query will disappear, ensuring a fresh start for each new search.
